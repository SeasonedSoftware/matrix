## We are using the baby steps strategy.

In this moment is possible:

- Execute login via Google Credentials
- Navigate into all rooms
- Notify clients when another connected user go away
- Redirect to /home when unlogged user enter in /office
- Open external meeting when the user enter in a room
- On reload, keep user in the last room
- Notify when an user enter in a room
- Identify when user in a video meeting
- Right click to call other user to my room

Next priority steps:

- Implement socket.io tests
- Configure code coverage codeclimate
- Refactoring before start refactor please read [[this article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-document-load.html)]

Next cool steps:

- Notify when an user go out in a room
